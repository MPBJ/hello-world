# hello-world
My first repository, and my first experience with GitHub!

I'm a 26 year old software student at Sinclair Community College, just a few months away from
getting my Associate's Degree in Software Development, with plans to continue my education afterward.

My interests include web design and development, game development, and mostly just learning new things. 
So far I've become relatively proficient in C++ and Java, and am hoping to start expanding my knowledge base
concerning HTML and JavaScript, as well as getting myself familiar with Linux systems and Python.

I'm excited to be here!
